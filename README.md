# Analytics Dashboard - React App

This project is a **React-based Analytics Dashboard** that provides real-time insights into user activity, including **Top Users**, **Trending Posts**, and a **Feed** of the latest posts. The app uses **Material-UI** for a clean and modern design, and the data is fetched from APIs to display relevant information.

## Features

- **Top Users**: Displays the top 5 users who have the most comments.
- **Trending Posts**: Shows posts with the most comments, with multiple posts displayed if they share the maximum comment count.
- **Feed**: Displays the latest posts in real-time, with the newest posts on top.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and beautiful design using Material-UI components.
